# LIVE behavioral suite orchestrator (FINAL-PLAN §4.1/§4.2/§4.4).
#
# This is the inverted-skip orchestrator: where tests/integration/run.sh exits 0
# whenever FAIL==0 (so an all-skipped run on a rotated/empty account reads GREEN
# — the exact disease this overhaul kills), tests/live/run.sh treats
# ALL-SKIPPED ⇒ RED, per profile, and promotes a SKIP of a git-declared
# (expect-full) kind to a FAIL.
#
# Usage:
#   tests/live/run.sh [LIVE_MODE]
#     LIVE_MODE = mutating | readonly   (arg overrides env; unset => readonly)
#
# Environment:
#   LIVE_PROFILE   full (DEFAULT) | verify-only | off     (which TIERS run)
#   LIVE_MODE      mutating | readonly                    (read-only vs mutating
#                  within the live tiers; unset => readonly, fail-closed)
#   LIVE_CLUSTER   cluster-under-test name (for expect-full derivation + evidence)
#   LIVE_EXPECT_FULL   (test seam) space-separated kinds; overrides git derivation
#   LIVE_CHECKS_ROOT   (test seam) dir holding after/ instantiate/ negative/
#                                  (default tests/live/checks)
#   LIVE_SKIP_REGISTER (test seam) path to the register (default tests/live/SKIP_REGISTER.yaml)
#
# Exit codes (orchestrator):
#   0  clean pass
#   1  FAIL (a check failed, or ALL-SKIPPED/empty under the active profile)
#   3  expect-full violation (a git-declared kind was not verified by a pass)
#   2  reserved for "no kube-API at all" not-applicable abort is NOT used here —
#      a precondition abort is a FAIL (fail-closed), see below.
