# LIVE negative check — ArgoCD AppProject sourceRepos guard fires.
#
# Guard under test:
#   argocd/projects/k8-platform.yaml spec.sourceRepos — only
#   "https://github.com/lago-morph/k8-platform.git" is allowed.
#   ArgoCD rejects an Application referencing any other repo with
#   "application repo <url> is not permitted in project k8-platform".
#
# Red-first discipline:
#   (a) DENIED: apply an Application whose spec.source.repoURL is NOT in
#       the allowlist; assert the denial reason names the specific guard
#       (project name + "not permitted" — NOT a generic/unrelated error).
#   (b) POSITIVE CONTROL: a closely matched Application using the allowed
#       repo is accepted — proves the guard is selective, not always-deny.
#
# Exit-code contract (tests/live/lib/live-lib.sh):
#   0 = pass, 2 = skip (readonly or tools absent), other = FAIL.
# Negatives do NOT emit `covers` (they do not satisfy kind-coverage).
#
# LIVE_MODE=mutating required — we apply (and delete) real manifests.
# In readonly we skip: ArgoCD enforcement only fires on apply/sync.
