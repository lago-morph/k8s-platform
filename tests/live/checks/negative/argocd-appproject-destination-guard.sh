# LIVE negative check — ArgoCD AppProject destination guard fires.
#
# Guard under test:
#   argocd/projects/platform-spoke.yaml spec.destinations — destinations
#   are scoped to spoke clusters by NAME (*-spoke); the hub in-cluster
#   server (https://kubernetes.default.svc) is EXPLICITLY excluded.
#   An Application in the platform-spoke project that targets the hub
#   must be rejected. Argo phrases a DESTINATION violation differently from a
#   source-repo one: measured live on build #7 (2026-09-10) the condition is
#     InvalidSpecError: application destination server '<hub>' and namespace
#     '<ns>' do not match any of the allowed destinations in project 'platform-spoke'
#   whereas a repo violation says "is not permitted in project". Matching only
#   the repo wording made this check a FALSE NEGATIVE: it reported the guard
#   ineffective while the guard was firing, and could never have detected a real
#   destination breach either (kp-2al.27).
#
# Red-first discipline:
#   (a) DENIED: apply an Application in project platform-spoke with
#       destination server=https://kubernetes.default.svc (the hub);
#       assert the denial reason names the specific guard
#       (project name + "not permitted" — NOT a generic/unrelated error).
#   (b) POSITIVE CONTROL: a destination that IS allowed (name=*-spoke
#       pattern) is accepted — proves the guard is selective.
#
# Exit-code contract (tests/live/lib/live-lib.sh):
#   0 = pass, 2 = skip (readonly or tools absent), other = FAIL.
# Negatives do NOT emit `covers`.
#
# LIVE_MODE=mutating required — we apply (and delete) real manifests.
