#!/usr/bin/env bash
# instantiate-lib.sh — the parametrized hermetic instantiate-and-verify harness
# for the LIVE behavioral suite (FINAL-PLAN §P4; ADR-0006).
#
# WHAT THIS IS. The `after` tier proves a resource the platform ALREADY
# provisioned is real+healthy (it selects by the Composition's crossplane-kind
# tag — see tests/live/checks/after/*-live.sh). This library is the rigorous
# complement: it CREATES a fresh resource by driving the REAL Crossplane
# controller (under its own IRSA identity — NOT an admin-AWS write), waits for
# the controller to converge it (Synced=True + Ready=True), REUSES an after-tier
# verify oracle to prove the real AWS resource exists+healthy, and then ALWAYS
# deletes it (trap-based) and waits for the delete to settle. It emits
# `covers <kind>` only on a verified success.
#
# WHY DRIVE THE CONTROLLER, NOT AWS DIRECTLY. The thing under test is the
# Crossplane abstraction end-to-end: manifest -> controller -> IRSA -> real AWS
# resource. An admin-AWS `aws iam create-role` would prove nothing about the
# platform. So the create path is `kubectl apply` of a managed resource against
# the hub, relayed through scripts/sandbox-kubeconfig.sh; the controller's own
# scoped IRSA (terraform/management/irsa.tf) performs the AWS write. If the
# resource is mis-named for those scoped perms the controller create fails
# CLOSED — which is exactly the contract this harness exercises.
#
# FAIL-CLOSED. The create path runs ONLY in LIVE_MODE=mutating. Unset/garbage
# LIVE_MODE degrades to readonly (live-lib.sh live_mode()), and in readonly this
# harness SKIPs (exit 2) WITHOUT applying anything. Mutating is OFF by default.
#
# REAPER CONTRACT (FINAL-PLAN §8). Every created resource carries the reaper's
# two required tags so a leaked resource (e.g. a killed run) is reclaimable by
# the P3 reaper, never orphaned:
#     live-verify=<RUN_ID>                  (the run-id the reaper deletes tag-conditioned on)
#     live-verify-created=<epoch-seconds>   (the age the reaper's age-floor compares against)
# A resource missing EITHER tag is fail-safe-protected by reaper-select.sh
# forever, so emitting both is mandatory, not cosmetic.
#
# This file holds ONLY the parametrized engine; the two concrete checks
# (tests/live/checks/instantiate/{iam-role,secretsmanager-secret}-instantiate.sh)
# supply a <kind>, a manifest-renderer fn, and a verify fn.
