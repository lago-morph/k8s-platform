# Derive the expected composed-MR coverage set from the committed v2
# Pipeline-mode Compositions, group/kind-keyed and version-stripped.
#
# FINAL-PLAN §4.5: the expected-coverage set is GENERATED (never hand-edited
# green); the human maintains only the registry of which test defends which
# kind (tests/coverage/registry.yaml). This script is the extractor + the
# drift gate that proves the committed oracle still matches what the
# Compositions declare.
#
# Usage:
#   derive-coverage.sh                 # print the derived group/kind set (sorted, unique)
#   derive-coverage.sh --expect-full   # print the EXPECT-FULL subset: the derived
#                                      # set MINUS the kinds registry.yaml marks
#                                      # `coverage: transitive` (kp-2al.20)
#   derive-coverage.sh --check         # compare derived set vs the committed
#                                      # oracle; honor tests/coverage/mode
#                                      # (warn => print drift, exit 0;
#                                      #  enforce => exit 1 on drift).
#
# Extraction path (round-3 k8s-expert C2): MR kinds live at
#   .spec.pipeline[].input.resources[].base
# Key on GROUP/KIND with the apiVersion VERSION stripped, deduped — so a
# v1beta1->v1beta2 provider bump does NOT change the key (a silent coverage
# miss exactly when an upgrade is riskiest). The select(.base) + .input.
# resources[] path structurally cannot emit ClusterProviderConfig / function
# Input|Resources wrappers / the Composition doc kind, so no exclude-list is
# needed; one is kept commented as documentation of that fact.
