# Every namespaced manifest synced by the crossplane-resources Application
# must target a namespace that exists at bootstrap time.
#
# The bug class (clean build #4, 2026-07-05): crossplane/rbac/02-* put a
# Role/RoleBinding in namespace `platform`, which is created by the
# platform-cluster-claim Application — a MANUAL deliberate-sync gate that
# fires ~15+ minutes after bootstrap. crossplane-resources' automated sync
# failed ("namespaces \"platform\" not found"), exhausted its 5 retries,
# and sat Failed/OutOfSync until an unrelated commit would retrigger it.
# Builds #1–#3 were masked by mid-build merges to main; build #4 was the
# first build without one and hit it: the ADR-0010 registration-Secret
# producer had no RBAC, so the spoke never registered.
#
# File set mirrors argocd/apps/crossplane-resources.yaml exactly:
#   include: {xrds/*.yaml,compositions/*.yaml,rbac/*.yaml,providerconfig/*.yaml}
#   exclude: **/render-fixtures/**
# (cross-checked below so a future include-glob change fails this test
# loudly instead of silently diverging).
#
# Bootstrap-guaranteed namespaces for this app's sync:
#   - kube-system/default: cluster built-ins.
#   - crossplane-system, argocd, external-secrets: created by the
#     management terraform helm releases BEFORE the ArgoCD bootstrap app
#     exists. (kyverno was in this set until the hub Kyverno install was
#     removed — bead kp-2al.17, reinstatement kp-caz.1/v2.0.)
#   - any namespace created by a committed Namespace manifest in the same
#     file set (ArgoCD applies Namespaces before namespaced kinds).
# Anything else must ship with the Application that creates its namespace
# (e.g. clusters/platform/ for ns `platform`).
