# auto-015-001 (OI-2026-06-08-1) — Sid-anchored SOURCE regression guard for the
# Crossplane provider IAM Resource scoping in terraform/management/irsa.tf.
#
# This is a LINT (a static source invariant on the file a human edits), not a
# behavioral proof — the firing proof is the live simulate-principal-policy deny
# check (tests/live/checks/negative/iam-resource-scope-denied.sh) + the spoke
# CREATE-path validation. Its job: catch a future human edit that (1) silently
# RE-WIDENS the narrowed role/OIDC statements back to "*", OR (2) prematurely
# OVER-NARROWS EKS/EC2/RDS/ACM (which are deliberately "*" — non-derivable ARNs).
#
# It is Sid-ANCHORED (per the harness-architect reviewer): test_iam_required_actions.sh
# flattens all statements and never reads Resource, so it cannot do this. We extract
# each statement's Resource by its Sid so we never false-match Route53/SecretsManager.
