# Proves THE MECHANISM ITSELF (not any live cloud): the inverted-skip
# tabulation, the LIVE_PROFILE selector, the LIVE_MODE fail-closed coupling,
# the expect-full promotion, the off-register guard, and the
# default-profile-as-tested-invariant. All hermetic — no cluster, no AWS.

# Drives tests/live/run.sh against a throwaway $LIVE_CHECKS_ROOT of stub checks
