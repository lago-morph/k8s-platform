  Reach GitHub's REST API from the Claude Code web sandbox by routing
  calls through the jentic MCP server. Use this skill to trigger CI
  runs via `workflow_dispatch`, list recent workflow runs, poll a
  specific run's status/conclusion, list the jobs in a run, and
  download per-job logs on failure — operations that the sandbox's
  attached GitHub MCP server does NOT expose and that direct egress to
  api.github.com is blocked from reaching. Drives the inner debug loop
  for `.github/workflows/terraform-test.yml` together with
  `terraform-ci-watch`. Trigger phrases: "workflow_dispatch",
  "trigger CI", "dispatch terraform-test", "list workflow runs",
  "get workflow run status", "list jobs for run", "download job logs",
  "get CI logs", "kick the build", "jentic GitHub", "the sandbox can't
  reach GitHub Actions API". Also creates/updates repo files — notably
  `.github/workflows/*` — that the git-push OAuth token and the GitHub MCP
  write tools both refuse (the `workflow`-scope gap); trigger phrases
  "write the workflow file", "push the workflow via jentic", "edit a file
  in .github/workflows".

# ext-github

Bridges the sandbox to GitHub's Actions REST API through the jentic
MCP server. Built per `ai/specs/ext-github-design.md` via the
`external-api-bridge` meta-skill. If the spec disagrees with anything
here, **the spec wins** — fix this skill, not the spec.

> **2026-09-08 update:** the sandbox's GitHub MCP server now exposes
> `actions_run_trigger` (workflow_dispatch) and `get_job_logs` natively —
> both verified working (run 34273668606). Prefer those for dispatch and
> logs; this skill's jentic path is still required for endpoint #5
> (writing `.github/workflows/*`) and stays as the fallback. Jentic's
> hosted execution is announced to end 2026-09-20 (`ai/environment.md`).

## 1. When to use

The sandbox's GitHub MCP server exposes PR/issue/content/branch/release
operations only; it does **not** cover the Actions API. Direct egress
to `api.github.com` is blocked. Use this skill whenever the agent
needs to drive `.github/workflows/terraform-test.yml` end-to-end:
dispatch a phase × action run, poll for completion, then on failure
fetch logs for diagnosis. Pairs with `terraform-ci-watch` (which owns
the polling loop and the 3-strike escalation envelope).

Auth: jentic holds a fine-grained PAT scoped to `lago-morph/k8s-platform`
(Actions: read+write, Contents: read+write, Workflows: read+write,
Metadata: read). No tokens enter this repo or sandbox. The Contents +
Workflows **write** grants were added 2026-06-06 specifically to enable
endpoint #5 — the only write path a web sandbox has for
`.github/workflows/*` files (the git-push OAuth token and the GitHub MCP
write tools both lack `workflow` scope). See §8.

> **Repo name:** the canonical repo is `lago-morph/k8s-platform`. The four
> read/dispatch recordings below still carry the pre-rename `k8-platform`
> and work via GitHub's redirect; the file-write recording uses the current
> `k8s-platform` (a write PUT should target the canonical name).

## 2. Endpoints

| Purpose | Endpoint | `resources/` file | jentic op | Last verified |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trigger a CI run | `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{workflow_id}/dispatches` | `workflow_dispatch.json` | `op_2acb005c9f3704ad` | 2026-05-23 |
| List recent runs of a workflow (and substitute for single-run GET) | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{workflow_id}/runs` | `list_workflow_runs.json` | `op_e5f9dfd148ed5018` | 2026-05-23 |
| List jobs in a run (step 1 of the logs workaround) | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/jobs` | `list_jobs_for_workflow_run.json` | `op_2064ead94c9950bc` | 2026-05-23 |
| Download per-job logs (substitute for run-wide logs) | `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/jobs/{job_id}/logs` | `download_job_logs.json` | `op_c08d23e5bd6966cb` | 2026-05-23 |
| Create/update a repo file (incl. `.github/workflows/*`) | `PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/{path}` | `create_or_update_file_contents.json` | `op_12ee1daaad73b14b` | 2026-06-06 |

`Last verified` is the date the recording was last confirmed working
against the live API. If a call from this skill starts failing and the
`Last verified` date is months stale, suspect jentic catalog drift or
GitHub API changes and re-run the live-fire probe per
`external-api-bridge/reference/procedure.md` before assuming a logic
bug. After any re-verify, bump the date here AND `recorded_at` /
`last_verified` in the corresponding `resources/*.json`.

## 3. Catalog gaps & workarounds

The PR2 live-fire (2026-05-23) found two endpoints in the spec's
original list that don't work as-stated through jentic. Both have a
verified substitute baked into the recordings above. Future agents:
do **not** try to call the broken forms; use the substitute.

### 3.1 No single-run GET (`actions/get-workflow-run` missing from catalog)

- **Original (spec §1):** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}` —
  not present in jentic's catalog as of 2026-05-23.
- **Substitute:** Call `list_workflow_runs.json` and filter the
  returned `workflow_runs[]` by `id == run_id`. The single-run GET's
  key fields (`status`, `conclusion`, `created_at`, `html_url`,
  `run_number`) are all present on each list entry. Bandwidth cost is
  trivial for the volumes this project sees (10–20 dispatches ever per
  the spec).
- **Re-check trigger:** if jentic ever adds `actions/get-workflow-run`,
  replace the substitute with a direct call and add a new
  `get_workflow_run.json` recording.

### 3.2 Run-wide logs endpoint returns 500 from jentic

- **Original (spec §1):** `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/logs` —
  catalog entry exists (`op_5d341526a28301a9`) but jentic returns
  `500 Internal Server Error`. GitHub's contract is a 302 redirect to
  a short-lived signed URL pointing at a zip archive; jentic does not
  follow that redirect, so the call fails through the bridge.
- **Substitute (two calls):**
  1. `list_jobs_for_workflow_run.json` — enumerate jobs in the run.
  2. `download_job_logs.json` per job — returns plain-text logs
     directly (no redirect, no zip). Concatenate bodies if multiple
     jobs.
  For `terraform-test.yml`'s current shape (one job per run) this is a
  one-extra-call substitute, not a real cost.
- **Re-check trigger:** if jentic adds 302-follow support OR a future
  child skill needs run-wide logs across many jobs, retry the original
  endpoint and record the result.

## 4. Retry policy

One-shot per call. No automatic retries inside this skill. On any
failure — jentic 4xx, jentic 5xx, GitHub 4xx, GitHub 5xx — stop and
escalate to the user (or to `terraform-ci-watch`'s outer envelope,
which owns the classified auto-redispatch decision per spec §4).

## 5. Concurrency precondition

Applies only to `workflow_dispatch` (the one mutating endpoint).

Before dispatching, call `list_workflow_runs.json` filtered to the
same `workflow_id` and (where relevant) the same `branch`. Count runs
whose `status` is `queued` or `in_progress` and whose `inputs`
match the intended `(ref, phase)`. If that count is `> 2`, **refuse**
the dispatch and report verbatim:

> "N runs already queued for {ref, phase}; please intervene."

No automatic diagnosis. No retry. The user unblocks. `terraform-test.yml`'s
`concurrency` block has `cancel-in-progress: false` so queued
dispatches wait their turn; this gate exists to prevent the queue
from growing unboundedly.

The four read endpoints (#2–#4 in the table) are read-only — concurrency
precondition is N/A.

## 6. Recorded request shape

The `resources/*.json` files are the source of truth for call shape.
Do **not** handcraft requests from GitHub's documentation; the
recordings capture exact verified inputs (including jentic's specific
input naming, which differs from raw REST in a few places — `owner`,
`repo`, `workflow_id`, etc. appear as top-level inputs rather than
path parameters).

All four recordings have `verified: true` (live-fired 2026-05-23).
None ship with `verified: false`.

## 7. Recovery on jentic outage

If a call from this skill fails for connectivity reasons (jentic 5xx,
rate-limited, unreachable, or the upstream PAT expired/got revoked),
write the intended next action — including target `workflow_id`,
`ref`, and `inputs` — to the Current Sandbox Session block at the top
of `ai/handoff.md`, commit, and stop. A human resumes by dispatching
manually via the GitHub Actions UI. See the "Jentic outage" paragraph
in `ai/testing-guidelines.md`.

## 8. Writing repo files — the `.github/workflows/*` path

Endpoint #5 (`create_or_update_file_contents.json`, `op_12ee1daaad73b14b`)
is the **only** way a Claude-Code-on-the-web sandbox can land a change to
a `.github/workflows/*` file. Both other write paths refuse it:

- `git push` over the in-container proxy → `remote rejected … refusing to
  allow an OAuth App to create or update workflow … without 'workflow'
  scope` (anthropics/claude-code #61189).
- the GitHub MCP write tools → `Resource not accessible` (same OAuth
  identity, no `workflow` scope).

This endpoint uses jentic's PAT instead, which carries Contents +
Workflows write (see §1). Use it for ANY repo file write the git path
can't do — workflow files are the main case; a normal source file should
still go via `git push` (cheaper, keeps local and remote in lockstep).

**Call contract:**

1. **`content` is base64 of the WHOLE file** — this PUT replaces the file
   wholesale, it does not patch. Build the new file locally, validate it
   (`python3 -c 'import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)'` for workflow YAML),
   then `base64 -w0`.
2. **`sha` is REQUIRED when updating** an existing file — it's the blob
   sha of the file being replaced (`git rev-parse HEAD:<path>` when local
   == remote). Omit `sha` only when creating a brand-new file. A stale or
   missing `sha` on an update returns `409 Conflict`.
3. **`branch`** — always target the feature branch, never `main`
   (AGENTS §3). Defaults to the repo's default branch if omitted, so do
   NOT omit it.
4. **The PUT creates its own commit on the remote** (committer = the PAT's
   user), so your local clone falls one commit behind. Reconcile with
   `git fetch origin <branch> && git reset --hard origin/<branch>` (safe
   when the only local change is the same edit you just PUT) — or `git
   pull --ff-only` if you kept the file unedited locally.
5. **One file per call.** For a multi-file workflow change, PUT each file
   serially (GitHub serializes contents writes per the op's own note;
   parallel writes conflict).

**Concurrency / safety:** like `workflow_dispatch` this is a mutating
call, but it is idempotent on content (re-PUTting identical bytes with the
current sha is a no-op commit). No concurrency gate beyond the correct
`sha`. One-shot per §4 — on any 4xx/5xx, stop and surface; a `409` almost
always means the `sha` is stale (re-fetch it and retry once).

**Live-fired 2026-06-06** against `lago-morph/k8s-platform`, branch
`claude/phase-6-cleanup-prep-xOZBG`, updating
`.github/workflows/unit-tests.yml` (the yq + crossplane CLI version pins) —
returned `200`, commit `803ef5f`. This is what proved the
Contents+Workflows write grant works end-to-end through jentic.

      trigger phrases.
- [x] §1 names the gap (no MCP coverage for Actions API + direct
      egress blocked) and the upstream service.
- [x] §2 every endpoint has a row pointing at an existing
      `resources/<endpoint>.json` plus a `Last verified` date.
- [x] §3 documents the two catalog/bridge gaps with substitute
      procedures.
- [x] §3 Test plan record covered below.
- [x] §4 one-shot, no retries, restated.
- [x] §5 concurrency gate set for `workflow_dispatch`; N/A noted for
      the read endpoints.
- [x] §6 recorded-shape pointer; no `verified: false` recordings ship.
- [x] §7 jentic-outage recovery present and pointing at handoff +
      testing-guidelines.
- [x] Every `resources/*.json` conforms to the schema in
      `external-api-bridge/resources/README.md`.
- [x] No aspirational scope: skill names only the four endpoints it
      can actually call.
