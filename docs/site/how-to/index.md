# How-to guides

Task-oriented recipes. Each guide gets one job done through the
platform's public surfaces, assuming you already know the basics (if
you do not, start with the [Tutorials](../tutorials/index.md)). Guides
state their preconditions, give runnable steps, and end with how to
verify the result.

## Guides

In the order a new tenant tends to need them:

- [Build the platform from nothing](build-the-platform-from-nothing.md)
  — the owner's guide and the **supported build path**: fresh account +
  this repository → running platform, via two workflow runs and the two
  gate syncs
- [Build the platform from a workstation](build-the-platform-on-a-workstation.md)
  — the copy/paste Terraform alternative; published, but never executed
  by a person and therefore unverified
- [Tear the platform down to nothing](tear-the-platform-down.md) — the
  mirror of the bring-up: the ordered teardown that does not strand
  paid resources, and how to leave an account equivalent-to-fresh
- [Get admin access and platform facts](admin-access.md) — the
  administrator's guide: kubeconfigs for both clusters, the Argo CD
  URL and password, and where the platform's discovered values live
- [Onboard a tenant](onboard-a-tenant.md) — documented as-is,
  including the operator hand-work
- [Deploy an application via GitOps](deploy-an-application.md)
- [Expose an application with a public hostname and TLS](expose-an-application.md)
- [Provision a platform secret and consume it](provision-a-platform-secret.md)
- [Provision a database and connect an application to it](provision-a-database.md)
- [Fulfil a tenant's database request](fulfil-a-database-request.md) —
  the administrator's runbook behind that guide: place the composite
  resource, push the credentials to Secrets Manager, hand the key back
  on the ticket
- [Check an application's health and find its URL](check-health-and-find-url.md)
- [Update and roll back an application](update-and-roll-back.md)
- [Add or upgrade a platform component](add-or-upgrade-a-component.md) — operator task
- [Get kubectl access via your directory group](kubectl-access-via-directory-group.md)
- [Log into platform UIs with SSO](log-into-platform-uis-with-sso.md)

Each guide carries its own stability marker. Anything not linked here
is not yet written.
