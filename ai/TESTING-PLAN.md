# Testing Plan

Three layers of test, plus a fourth planned for phase 2+. Each runs in a
different environment and catches a different class of bug.

| Layer | Lives at | Runs against | Catches | Cost per run |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Unit | `tests/unit/` | Local shell — no AWS, no cluster | Helm chart value contracts, IRSA wiring, IAM-policy completeness, EKS module tripwires | <30s |
| ~~Kyverno (audit)~~ | `policies/` | **Dormant — not installed** | (was: drift from any source — chart bump, hand edit, Argo sync, new namespace) | n/a |
| Integration | `tests/integration/` | Live management cluster + AWS | Real end-to-end flows — IRSA STS, ExternalDNS → Route53, Crossplane → S3, Argo selfHeal | ~10–15 min for all 10 |
| Chainsaw (planned) | `tests/chainsaw/` | `kind` cluster ± LocalStack | XRD / Composition / Claim logic before any AWS apply | <2 min per scenario |

The matrix is intentionally non-overlapping. Unit tests catch authoring-time
mistakes. The Kyverno drift layer is dormant: the hub install was removed
(bead kp-2al.17, reinstatement kp-caz.1/v2.0) and the policy manifests are
kept unapplied under `policies/` — see `policies/README.md`. Integration
tests catch
real-cloud failures. Chainsaw will catch Crossplane logic bugs in seconds
instead of waiting for the 15-minute management apply.

## Layer 4 (planned): Chainsaw for Crossplane

**Status:** intent recorded; concrete tests authored when phase 2 begins.

### Why Chainsaw, why now-but-not-quite-yet

[Kyverno Chainsaw](https://kyverno.github.io/chainsaw/) is a declarative
Kubernetes end-to-end test runner. Each scenario is YAML: a sequence of
`apply` / `assert` / `wait` / `delete` steps, with built-in retry and
timeout. It runs against any reachable cluster — typically a fresh `kind`
cluster in CI.

Chainsaw's sweet spot is multi-step Kubernetes flows with timing concerns,
which is exactly the shape of Crossplane testing:

```yaml
apiVersion: chainsaw.kyverno.io/v1alpha1
kind: Test
metadata: { name: platformsecret-claim }
spec:
  steps:
    - apply: { file: ../../crossplane/xrds/platform-secret.yaml }
    - apply: { file: ../../crossplane/compositions/platform-secret.yaml }
    - apply: { file: fixtures/test-claim.yaml }
    - assert: { file: assertions/composite-ready.yaml }
    - assert: { file: assertions/secret-materialized.yaml }
```

Compared to `bash + kubectl + wait_for` (what `tests/integration/06` does
today):
- Tests are declarative, easier to review
- Retry / timeout / poll-interval are first-class fields
- Cleanup happens automatically
- `kind` lifecycle is one config block away

It's not the right tool **today** because phase 1 has no XRDs / Compositions
/ Claims yet — there's nothing for Chainsaw to test that the existing
`helm template` unit tests don't already cover faster.

### When it lands

Phase 2 introduces the first XRDs:
- `PlatformSecret` (AWS Secrets Manager + ESO ClusterSecretStore + ExternalSecret)
- `PlatformCluster` (full EKS via Crossplane AWS provider)

When the phase 2 work starts, the first thing added is the Chainsaw test
infrastructure:

1. `tests/chainsaw/` directory with sub-trees per XRD.
2. A `kind` config under `tests/chainsaw/kind-config.yaml` that
   pre-installs Crossplane v2 + AWS provider stub.
3. Per-XRD `Test` files plus assertion manifests.
4. A `tests/chainsaw/run.sh` that wraps `kind create` → install
   Crossplane → run chainsaw → kind destroy. Target wall-clock: <3 min.
5. A `chainsaw` job in `.github/workflows/terraform-test.yml` that runs
   on every PR touching `crossplane/`.

### What it does NOT replace

- The existing integration tests (05, 06) still run against the real
  account to catch issues a kind + stub setup can't see: real IRSA,
  real AWS API rate limits, real-provider package install behaviour,
  Route53 propagation. Chainsaw lives upstream of those — it catches
  the Composition-logic bugs before they reach the 15-minute apply.
- Unit-test contracts on helm chart rendering still belong in
  `tests/unit/test_helm_render.sh`. Chainsaw runs YAML, not Helm
  values, so per-chart bugs aren't its concern.

### Open design questions for the phase-2 author

- Real AWS or LocalStack for the provider's calls? Real AWS gives
  high-fidelity test, costs us account quota; LocalStack is free but
  the Crossplane AWS provider doesn't always like its responses.
  Default plan: **real AWS, scoped to a single test bucket prefix**.
- Crossplane v2 in kind needs ~2 GB RAM. CI runner needs to be sized
  accordingly. Self-hosted runner would help, but introduces a
  maintenance surface — start with GH-hosted and revisit.
- Per-scenario kind cluster vs. shared kind cluster across scenarios?
  Per-scenario is cleaner but slower. Default plan: **shared cluster
  per Chainsaw run, scenarios serialized**.

## Bug-class registry (the traceability matrix)

For every bug class encountered, the table below records the failure,
the test layer that catches it, and any diagnostic improvements made
in response. This table is **normative input** to the `AGENTS.md §6.4`
adversarial-reviewer brief — paste it into the brief verbatim when
asking subagents to attack a new test plan.

### Maintenance discipline

- Add a row **whenever a new bug class is discovered**, before the PR
  that fixes it is marked ready. "New bug class" = a failure not yet
  represented in this table.
- One row per class, not per occurrence. If the same root cause shows
  up twice, append a `(N×)` count to the row rather than duplicating.
- Per `AGENTS.md §6.2`, fixing a bug requires writing a test that
  catches it. The "Catches it" column points at that test.
- When a row's catching test moves files or is renamed, update the
  row in the same commit so future readers can follow the link.

### Registry

| Bug class | Catches it | Faster diagnostic added |
|---|---|---|
| EKS v20 `enable_cluster_creator_admin_permissions` default | `tests/unit/test_eks_module_defaults.sh` | n/a — terraform error is immediate |
| RBAC race on first helm release | (none — race condition; fixed by retry semantics) | retry built into the loop |
| argocd IRSA on top-level SA, not server.SA | `tests/unit/test_helm_render.sh`; `policies/audit/01-argocd-server-irsa.yaml` | n/a |
| ExternalDNS install missing entirely | `tests/unit/test_irsa_helm_linkage.sh` | n/a |
| bitnami external-dns chart stuck | `tests/unit/test_helm_render.sh` (chart-specific helm template would fail) | n/a |
| external-dns IRSA missing ListHostedZones | `tests/unit/test_iam_required_actions.sh` | `scripts/diag-component.sh external-dns` dumps the AccessDenied logs |
| argocd ingress.hosts vs ingress.hostname | `tests/unit/test_helm_render.sh`; `policies/audit/03-ingress-managed-by-external-dns.yaml` | DNS-failure diagnostic in workflow now dumps ingress YAML |
| AWS account rotated; no Route53 zone in new account | `scripts/aws-creds-check.sh` (preflight before any apply-and-verify dispatch) | n/a |
| `post-comment.py` `STEP_LABELS` missing keys present in `OUTCOMES` (silent until a test-* step fails, then `KeyError` masks the real CI failure) | `tests/unit/test_post_comment.sh` (keys-equal invariant + per-failure-path scenarios) | n/a — Python traceback is immediate |
| Kyverno ClusterPolicy JMESPath literal with empty backticks (`` `` ``); accepted by yaml-load, rejected by admission webhook at apply time, takes down the management apply step mid-way after sibling policies have already landed | `tests/unit/test_kyverno_policy_lint.sh` (static lint of every backticked literal in `policies/audit/*.yaml`) | n/a — webhook error message is precise |
| Chainsaw / kind / Crossplane chart version drift between `tests/chainsaw/versions.env` and `terraform/management/variables.tf` — a Composition passes Chainsaw in the kind cluster but breaks on apply against management because the runtime versions differ | `tests/unit/test_chainsaw_kind_config.sh` (extracts both default literals via `awk`, asserts equality) | n/a |
| XRD authored without `served: true` / `referenceable: true` on the only version; claim apply returns 404 with no useful error from the API server | `tests/unit/test_platform_secret_xrd.sh` (and similar for future XRDs) | n/a — gate surfaces at unit-test time, never at the cluster |
| Composition Patch sourcing `metadata.namespace` from a cluster-scoped composite (always empty) instead of `spec.claimRef.namespace`; downstream ExternalSecret silently lands in `crossplane-system` instead of the claim's namespace | `tests/unit/test_platform_secret_composition.sh` (asserts `fromFieldPath == spec.claimRef.namespace` for the ExternalSecret's `metadata.namespace` patch) | n/a |
| ArgoCD Application `targetRevision` left as `HEAD` (silently follows force-pushes) or `source.path` pointing at a non-existent directory | `tests/unit/test_argocd_app_revision_pinned.sh` (iterates every `argocd/apps/*.yaml`) | n/a |
