# Session Handoff — k8-platform

This file is the first thing a new session reads. It captures what was done
last, the current state, and the next concrete steps. Keep it factual
(AGENTS §8.3) and prune resolved items so the next session isn't misled.

## NEW SESSION QUICKSTART (read this first)

> ## ▶ 2026-09-08 — 🟢 STEP 1 OF THE NEW PLAN: repo re-verified after two idle months; fresh account probed; gate-ordering defect fixed in the recipe
> **Branch `claude/happy-goodall-3raowd`.** `main` = `d5e1ae1` (2026-07-05),
> no open PRs, all last gates green. Fresh Pluralsight account
> `058264287172` (empty: no EKS/state bucket/OIDC/Cognito; hosted zone only). <!-- noqa: account-id - run provenance, account rotates -->
> **GHA secrets VERIFIED for the new account** by the creds probe
> `terraform-test.yml` test/test-e2e run **34273668606** (creds PASS, zone
> PASS, state backend FAIL = expected before bootstrap). Dispatched and read
> via the **native GitHub MCP tools** (`actions_run_trigger`,
> `get_job_logs`) — first time; jentic not needed for dispatch/logs
> (`ai/environment.md` §6). Jentic hosted execution ends 2026-09-20.
> **Fixed this branch:** the build recipe waited for the XPlatformCluster
> XR Ready before pulling `spoke-access`, which deadlocks now that the
> IdP association (needs Keycloak, which needs spoke-access) is composed
> (retro 2026-07-06-255 remedy 8, never landed). Recipe now waits on the
> four published status facts + NodeGroup Ready, pulls gate 2, then waits
> XR Ready last (`docs/site/how-to/build-the-platform-from-nothing.md`;
> headers of `argocd/apps/spoke-access.yaml` and the XSpokeAccess XR).
> **Sandbox git facts (probed):** branch create + force-with-lease OK;
> non-branch refs and branch deletes → HTTP 403. Leftover branch
> `probe-delete-me-ref-test` on origin needs owner deletion (UI).
> **Beads groundwork:** `ai/beads-dolt-git-remotes.md` (condensed Dolt
> git-remote + beads facts + sandbox constraints + step-2 experiments).
> **STEP 2 INTAKE (owner plan 2026-09-08, steps 1–6):** replace this
> handoff + roadmap; classify every open issue defect-vs-feature for the
> "feature complete" definition (all non-feature OIs resolved; anything
> installed and erroring fixed + minimally tested); seed beads (Dolt on a
> branch ref, hooks-driven); rewrite the AGENTS.md posture block; carry
> the uncovered items from closed issue #22 into beads (shellcheck,
> actionlint, python lint, a `pull_request:` trigger = LESSONS S4).
> Retros are NOT harvested until the owner asks.


> ## ▶ 2026-07-06 LATEST — 🟢 ES ANTI-DRIFT DEFECT fixed red-first (L40); tunnel-reuse + docs remedies; retro addendum. PR #260. (Post-merge association verify was ALSO done independently by #259 — see that block below; this branch adds the defect #259 missed.)
> **Branch `claude/post-merge-propagation-verify-doeg57`, PR #260 (rebased
> onto `main` past #256–#259).** Account `975050361443` live + converged. <!-- noqa: account-id - run provenance, account rotates -->
> **The one thing #259 didn't catch:** the new cognito ExternalSecret sat
> spoke-keycloak **permanently OutOfSync** — three ESO-CRD-defaulted enums
> (`conversionStrategy`/`decodingStrategy`/`metadataPolicy`) omitted from
> `dataFrom[].extract`; ArgoCD's array diff can't ignore live-only
> additions, so selfHeal no-op-loops forever. Fixed red-first (contract
> test 3 FAIL → 55/55) + repo-wide lint `test_externalsecret_antidrift_enums.sh`
> (**L40**, enforced). Converges to Synced on merge (sources track `main`).
> **Delivery chain also proved live** (SUBSTRATE row 10 retrofit note): ES
> synced 12 s after terraform staged the ASM container; both KC pods
> rolled with the fail-closed `KC_COGNITO_*` env; broker ABSENT in the
> live realm via admin API (IGNORE_EXISTING). The EKS-side association
> ACTIVE is #259's record (row 11) — not re-litigated here.
> **Other remedies:** `sandbox-kubeconfig.sh` tunnel reuse (ends the
> setsid FATAL-flap; 5 cases live-tested); `ai/testing-guidelines.md` §7.1
> (run-ID-under-exact-HEAD sequencing); `self-retrospective` Step 0.5
> now checks `origin/main` for an existing retro before authoring.
> **Retro DONE:** `retrospective/2026-07-06-255-a.md` (addendum — the #255
> session merged its own retro as #257 mid-flight; #256 the L38/L39 rows +
> ADR-0013/0014). ADR-577f9c104d contract-docs-first draft proposed.
> **NEXT (supersedes the #259 "retro owed" note below — retro is done):**
> nothing on THIS account (build #5 fully exercised: evidence pass green,
> association ACTIVE, delivery chain proven, ES drift fixed). Rows 10/11
> need **clean build #6 on a ROTATED account**; stretch OI-2026-06-11-3/-4.


> ## ▶ 2026-07-06 (latest) — 🟢🟢🟢 CLEAN BUILD #5 + THE EVIDENCE PASS COMPLETE: all six oracles recorded, live-verify's first honest GREEN, OI-2026-06-12-1 CLOSED; phase-5 identity BUILT (pending build #6)
> **Everything on branch `claude/clean-build-5-evidence-ykmchk` (PR open —
> merge is the next owner action).** Account `975050361443`. <!-- noqa: account-id - run provenance, account rotates -->
> **Build #5 (zero manual steps, from `main` b85d7f2/0739c5e):** probe
> **28757370347** → base **28757434684** → management **28757800712**
> (first-attempt green — #245's first clean pass) → claim gate synced by
> explicit SHA (XR Ready 21 min) → spoke-access → registration Secret on
> its own → full stack Synced+Healthy incl. keycloak (observability pair
> = OI-2026-06-11-3; workload1 by design). ADR-0012 chain converged from
> committed source; Keycloak booted on the cross-cluster pull.
> **THE EVIDENCE PASS (the point):** all six oracles PASS recorded

> Fixed code-not-hands same-session (policy verbs incl. the phase-5

> rows 1–5+8 = 4×, 6/7 = 3×, 9 = 2×.
> **PHASE-5 IDENTITY BUILT (same branch; rows 10/11 pending build #6):**

> unset placeholders survive verbatim so `${CLAIM.email}` coexists);
> delivery = terraform/base → ASM `k8-platform/base/cognito` → spoke ES →
> NON-optional secretKeyRef env (pod can't start with the Secret missing
> — fail-closed by construction; the Cognito client secret is
> Cognito-generated so the ADR-0012 generate-once chain CANNOT carry it —

> k8s-admins/k8s-viewers groups now terraform-managed.
> **KNOWN PROPERTIES (not defects):** a live realm never re-imports
> (IGNORE_EXISTING — realm changes converge at the next fresh-DB build);
> the IdP association on a fresh build fail-retries until Keycloak's
> issuer serves (extends XR Ready by the app-stack time).
> **POST-MERGE ASSOCIATION VERIFIED LIVE (2026-07-06 02:04Z, not via the
> timer — checked in-session):** after #255 merged, the live build-#5
> platform XR gained the 16th resource by GitOps auto-sync and the EKS
> association reached **ACTIVE** — `eks-identity-provider-config-live`
> PASS (issuer `auth.platform.<domain>/realms/platform`, claim contract correct);
> the composite XR is Synced=True **Ready=True** (NO upjet wedge). This

> 10/11 — the realm broker (REQ-AUTH-02/08) is only real on a fresh-DB
> build, so full sign-in→kubectl federation still awaits build #6.
> **NEXT SESSION: (1)** rows 10/11 evidence needs **clean build #6** on a
> ROTATED account (a live realm never re-imports; build #5's association
> is already confirmed ACTIVE above) — same recipe (then
> the federation oracle in mutating mode + all oracles + live-verify —
> note the promoted expect-full kinds now enforce). **(2)** Retro for THIS
> session (self-retrospective; the 2026-07-05-252 retro covered through
> #252). **(3)** Stretch: OI-2026-06-11-4 (CI-harness queue),

> observability pair). Parallel tracks stay in `planning/scenario-corpus/`.

> ## ▶ 2026-07-05 NIGHT (docs track) — 🟢 DOCS SITE LIVE WITH THE FULL "NOW" WAVE; scenario corpus is unblocked
> **Parallel documentation session (`planning/scenario-corpus/documentation-plan.md`).
> The site is LIVE and publishes on every merge to main:
> <https://lago-morph.github.io/k8s-platform/>.**
> **Merged: #247** (skeleton: `docs/site/` diataxis layout, `docs/mkdocs.yml`
> — NOT at root, `test_root_file_allowlist` — `docs/hooks/status_banner.py`
> enforcing `status: stable|contract|draft` front matter via

> tutorial, the topology explanation — 16 pages total, all `stable`,
> authored from committed sources (XRDs, Compositions, AppProjects,
> ApplicationSets, chainsaw scenarios, ADR-0003/0010/0012) with v2
> vocabulary (XR, never "claim").
> **Owner focus: scenario authoring starts NOW against the published
> site** (docs-blindness per `planning/scenario-corpus/charter.md`; the
> blocked-on-docs count is the docs quality metric).
> **Docs still owed (later waves, not blockers):** phase-5 identity pages
> written as `contract` in their own owner-reviewed PR (they double as the
> phase-5 spec); observability pages once the storage gap closes; docs
> upkeep = new pages ride the PRs that change public surfaces. Docs
> sessions need NO cluster/AWS access; the strict build is the only gate.

> ## ▶ 2026-07-05 EVE (superseded by 2026-07-06 above) — 🟢 MATERIAL CHAIN LIVE ON BUILD #4; FOUR live defects fixed in code; oracles + live-verify still OWED
> **Session end state (sandbox expired mid-build; all work merged, all
> gates that ran are green).** Seven PRs merged to `main` (HEAD
> `145ea6e`), each with its honest gates:
> **#243** the OI-2026-06-12-1 material chain (chainsaw
> **28745436950** green for exact HEAD; ADR-0012 adopted) · **#244**
> handoff · **#245** kubeconfig truncate-race fix (11 provisioners
> shared one truncate-rewritten file; validated by management attempt
> #3 = run **28750304494** green) · **#246** scenario-corpus charter
> package (parallel track) · **#248** producer-RBAC bootstrap-ordering
> fix (chainsaw **28752221450** green; the RBAC now rides the claim
> app with 00-namespace) · **#250** tag-charset fix (parens/comma in
> XR descriptions broke CreateSecret) · **#251**
> secretsmanager:GetResourcePolicy for the crossplane policy (upjet's
> observe path; applied by management run **28755969208** green).
> **Build #4 chain (fresh account `211125323087`):** probe <!-- noqa: account-id - run provenance, account rotates -->
> **28744551280** → base **28746752536** → management **28750304494**
> (+ final policy apply **28755969208**) → both deliberate-sync gates
> pulled (claim re-pulled at `5d75248` after bootstrap propagated the

> ingress-nginx / external-dns / eso / keycloak ALL Synced+Healthy
> (observability pair = known OI-2026-06-11-3; workload1-cluster
> OutOfSync by design).
> **THE HEADLINE (observed live 21:57Z, not yet oracle-recorded):
> both XPlatformSecret XRs Synced=True Ready=True — the platform
> generated material, the SecretVersions wrote AWSCURRENT into the
> deterministic containers, the spoke keycloak-admin ES pulled the
> cross-cluster key, and Keycloak BOOTED on it.** ADR-0012 works

> defense-in-depth the oracle layers predict.
> **NOT DONE — the evidence half (owed to the next session):**
> (1) the six oracles were NEVER RUN as recorded checks
> (hello-e2e-live, spoke-cluster-secret-live, sandbox-kubectl-relay,
> rds-instance-live, keycloak-e2e-live, + the ASM AWSCURRENT check);
> (2) **live-verify.yml was NEVER DISPATCHED** — OI-2026-06-12-1's
> close condition (live-verify green) is UNMET and the OI stays OPEN;
> (3) SUBSTRATE-READINESS has NO build-#4 row yet (no oracle run IDs =
> no row, per the gate's own rule); (4) no retrospective for this
> session yet.
> **NEXT SESSION:** (1) `scripts/whereami.sh` — if account
> `211125323087` is still alive, run the six oracles + dispatch <!-- noqa: account-id - run provenance, account rotates -->
> `live-verify.yml` immediately (substrate is up and converged),
> record run IDs in SUBSTRATE + close OI-2026-06-12-1; if rotated,
> clean build #5 from `main` (zero manual steps — all four fixes are
> merged; recipe unchanged) then the same evidence pass. (2) Phase-5
> identity half (SUBSTRATE rows 10/11; the docs plan says its
> user-facing pages get written as `contract` first). (3) Stretch:
> OI-2026-06-11-4, OI-2026-06-11-3. Parallel tracks live in
> `planning/scenario-corpus/` (charter → new scenarios repo; docs
> plan → docs-track session).

> ## ▶ 2026-07-05 (superseded by EVE above) — 🟢 MATERIAL CHAIN MERGED (#243, ADR-0012 adopted); account rotated to `211125323087`; next = clean build #4 <!-- noqa: account-id - run provenance, account rotates -->
> **The OI-2026-06-12-1 rework is LANDED on `main` (`b2880a9`).** Creds

> **What remains for OI-2026-06-12-1 to CLOSE: live-verify.yml green**
> — needs build #4's substrate (the scoped verifier role + provisioned
> XRs); dispatch it after the spoke + keycloak-secrets sync.
> **NEXT (run order): (1) clean build #4 from `main`** (`b2880a9`) —
> same recipe as #1–#3: base → management `apply-and-verify`; sync
> `platform-cluster-claim` then `spoke-access` via the SSM relay
> (`argocd app sync --core`, no patches); all six oracles incl. the
> material chain's live evidence; append run IDs to
> SUBSTRATE-READINESS. **(2) live-verify.yml** (closes

> **Build-#4 note:** TWO real committed defects surfaced (both fixed

> truncate-rewritten kubeconfig (parallelism race; builds #1–#3 won the
> timing) — #245, `test_tf_provisioner_kubeconfig_isolation.sh`;
> management attempt #3 (run 28750304494) GREEN with the fix. (2) The
> ADR-0010 producer RBAC lived in crossplane/rbac/ but targets ns
> `platform`, created only by the MANUAL claim gate ~15 min after
> bootstrap — crossplane-resources' auto-sync failed "namespaces
> \"platform\" not found", exhausted retries, spoke never registered
> (masked on builds #1–#3 by mid-build merges retriggering the sync).
> Moved to clusters/platform/01-provider-kubernetes-rbac.yaml (rides
> the claim app include list with 00-namespace.yaml);
> `test_crossplane_resources_namespace_bootstrap_safe.sh` pins the
> class. Re-pull BOTH gates after merging (claim app then spoke-access
> — the claim sync now also applies the RBAC).
> **Sandbox note:** this remote sandbox's egress policy 403s
> github.com release downloads (helm charts, yq, kubeconform binaries)

> Tool workaround: `go install` via proxy.golang.org (yq, kubeconform).

### ⏭ NEXT PHASE (proposed, assessed-feasible, NOT yet implemented) — give the sandbox direct `kubectl`

**Sequence.** This is the **immediate next focused session** — full build spec in
[`planning/sandbox-kubectl-access-task.md`](../planning/sandbox-kubectl-access-task.md).
Do it **first**: direct `kubectl` makes finishing the P0 spike and building the
behavioural test layers much easier. **As soon as it is done, kick off the
test-strategy continuation** — the auto-013 "CARRIED FORWARD" items above (finish
the P0 spike: `spec.crossplane.resourceRefs` on a live XR + drive-a-claim ⇒ real
`AccessDenied`; the jentic workflow-integration capstone; then P2–P6). The two are
sequential, not parallel.

**Goal.** Let this sandbox run `kubectl` against the cluster API directly, instead of
going through the `kube-diagnose` CI workflow + the ArgoCD REST API for every live
read. Tighter inner loop. Wanted **for every cluster we create** (hub + spokes), so
the plumbing belongs in the `XPlatformCluster` Composition, not a one-off on the hub.

**Why it's blocked today (the real constraint, confirmed against our config).** Our
EKS endpoints are *already public* (`cluster_endpoint_public_access = true` on the
hub in `terraform/management/eks.tf`; `endpointPublicAccess: true` in the cluster
Composition). So network reach is **not** the problem. TLS is: the Anthropic egress
gateway verifies the *upstream* server certificate against **public** roots, and the
EKS API server always presents a cert signed by the cluster's **private** CA → every
direct kube-API call 503s. (Trusting the gateway's own MITM CA fixes only the
sandbox→gateway leg; the gateway→EKS leg still fails.) This is the exact reason
ArgoCD needed a public ACM cert on its NLB before the sandbox could reach it.

```

#### The two approaches, assessed

**Approach B — give each cluster's API a publicly-trusted cert (the preferred
option): NOT FEASIBLE on EKS.** The API-server serving certificate is part of the
AWS-managed control plane. EKS exposes no knob to replace it with an ACM/public
cert, and no way to attach a custom domain to the managed `*.eks.amazonaws.com`
endpoint. Making the endpoint public (already done) does not change the cert. The
only way to present a publicly-trusted cert for the kube API is to put something *in
front* of it — which is Approach A. (A self-managed control plane — kops/kubeadm —
could set the apiserver cert, but moving off managed EKS is a non-starter.)

**Approach A — a non-cluster AWS resource that fronts the API with a public cert:
FEASIBLE.** The pattern is already proven by ArgoCD, and two building blocks for
"all clusters" already exist: the per-cluster DNS-validated **ACM cert the
Composition already mints** (`*.platform.<domain>` + its `CertificateValidation`)
and the Route53 zone. The catch is *which* front-end: `kubectl` is not only
request/response — it also does long-lived watches and **bidirectional connection
upgrades** for `exec`/`port-forward`/`attach` — so the choice decides how much of
kubectl actually works.

| Front-end (non-cluster AWS resource) | Public-cert source | kubectl coverage | Compute footprint | Main risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lambda function URL** (the example given) | auto AWS public cert | plain CRUD only (`get`/`apply`/`delete`); **`exec`/`port-forward` break**; 15-min + payload caps | serverless | streaming/upgrade limits make it a partial kubectl |
| **NLB with a TLS listener** (ACM public cert) → EKS endpoint | our ACM cert | **full kubectl** (L4 passthrough forwards the raw stream, so HTTP/2 + websockets + SPDY all work) | none (pure AWS resource) | the EKS endpoint is AWS-managed IPs behind a DNS name; NLB targets are IPs → needs an IP-refresh mechanism |
| **Small reverse proxy** (nginx/haproxy on Fargate) behind NLB+ACM | our ACM cert | full kubectl, proxies by DNS (no IP problem) | a small standing service (still non-cluster) | one always-on component to run/patch |
| **SSM Session Manager port-forward tunnel** (not named, strong) | the AWS `ssmmessages` endpoint's public cert | **full kubectl** — raw TCP tunnel; kubectl does real end-to-end TLS to the apiserver and **verifies the real cluster CA, no cert substitution** | a tiny SSM-registered instance per VPC | does the egress gateway permit the SSM data-channel **websocket**? (short `aws` calls already pass; a long-lived websocket is untested) |

#### Recommendation (this is opinion, not a settled decision)

Two finalists. If you want **zero standing compute** and only need CRUD-ish kubectl,
the **NLB TLS-passthrough** is the cleanest pure-AWS-resource path — but solve the
IP-target refresh. If you want **full kubectl** (`exec`/`port-forward`/`logs -f`)
with the least cert fuss, the **SSM port-forward tunnel** is the most elegant
(kubectl verifies the real cluster CA; nothing internet-facing is added) — but it
must pass a one-time gateway-websocket test first. Lambda is the weakest finalist
(no `exec`/`port-forward`).

#### Validate before building it "for all clusters"

First step is a **throwaway proof on the existing hub** that the chosen mechanism's
TLS/handshake passes the egress gateway and that `kubectl get nodes` returns —
*before* wiring it into the Composition. For SSM: stand up one SSM-managed instance,
try `aws ssm start-session ... AWS-StartPortForwardingSessionToRemoteHost
host=<eks-endpoint> portNumber=443 localPortNumber=8443` from the sandbox, point
kubeconfig at `https://localhost:8443`. For NLB: one NLB + the ACM cert + a target
group at the hub endpoint. The gateway-websocket question is the single thing that
decides SSM-vs-NLB, so test it first.

#### Needed regardless of mechanism

- **Auth.** kubectl still needs a valid token: the sandbox has AWS creds, runs
  `aws eks get-token`, and the cluster needs an **EKS access entry** for the
  sandbox's IAM identity (`user/cloud_user`) with read RBAC — the same access-entry
  work already tracked for the CI identity (FINAL-PLAN §14.2 / owner-decision #2).
- **Security tradeoff.** A public-cert proxy adds an internet-facing kube-API
  surface — restrict it with the EKS public-access CIDR allowlist (to the gateway
  egress IPs, if they're stable) on top of IAM/access-entry auth. The **SSM tunnel
  adds no public listener** (IAM-gated, nothing inbound) — strictly better on this
  axis, another point in its favour.
- **"For all clusters."** Fold the chosen resource into the `XPlatformCluster`
  Composition next to the ACM `Certificate` it already provisions, so every hub and
  spoke gets it automatically.

#### Effort (descriptive, not hours)

Approach B is ruled out, so no work there. Approach A is a small, self-contained
build on top of existing AWS primitives plus the ACM cert the Composition already
mints: the **SSM-tunnel** variant is mostly configure-existing (one SSM instance +
IAM + a kubeconfig helper); the **NLB** variant is mostly AWS wiring plus the
IP-refresh wrinkle. The gateway-websocket spike that picks between them is a single
short throwaway test.

**If A's validation fails** (gateway blocks the SSM websocket *and* the NLB
IP-target proves too fragile): keep today's working path — `kube-diagnose` workflow
for kube reads + the ArgoCD REST API — and treat direct sandbox kubectl as
not-worth-the-cost.

**Resume context: 2026-06-06 (`auto-007` — phase-3 provisioning push) on a LIVE
account (phases 0-1 already applied, management cluster up). Cleared FOUR phase-3
blockers; the `XPlatformCluster` XR reached `Ready=False/Creating` with 11 managed
resources composing before the AWS account was RESET (~02:30). Code is durable in
git; live AWS is gone. The auto-005 "rebuild 0→2" content further below still
applies on the fresh account.**

Branches/PRs from this session (NOT merged):
- **#149** `fix/management-argocd-cert-coverage` — the `*.management.<domain>` ACM
  cert (`acm-management.tf`) + ingress-nginx ssl-cert repoint, PLUS `node_min_size=3`
  and the VPC-CNI **prefix-delegation** addon (`eks.tf`).
- **#150** `docs/agents-never-remove-error-checks` — AGENTS §6.23 (never disable a
  check to dodge an undiagnosed error).
- **this PR** `chore/handoff-phase3-progress-2026-06-06` — render-fixtures exclude
  fix (`argocd/apps/crossplane-resources.yaml`) + this handoff.

### The FOUR phase-3 blockers found + fixed this session

1. **ArgoCD unreachable from sandbox — cert SAN gap (the "directly reachable" note
   below was WRONG).** The base wildcard `*.<acct>.realhandsonlabs.net` covers only
   ONE label, so NOT the two-label host `argocd.management.<acct>…`. The sandbox
   egress is an Anthropic MITM gateway doing STRICT upstream SAN verification → 503
   "verify SAN list", refused to proxy. FIX (#149): a dedicated `*.management.<domain>`
   ACM cert on the ingress NLB. After it landed, `argocd login` from the sandbox works.
2. **`kubectl` from the sandbox is STRUCTURALLY blocked.** The same gateway can't
   verify the EKS API's **private-CA** serving cert on the upstream leg (`unable to
   get local issuer certificate`) → every kube-API call 503s. Trusting the gateway
   CA fixes the CLIENT leg only. Use the **`argocd` CLI** (via the public NLB) + the
   **AWS CLI** for all sandbox-side diagnostics; kube-API needs CI.
3. **ingress-nginx admission-webhook hook timeout = pod-IP exhaustion, NOT mem/CPU.**
   Both t3.medium nodes were at 3/3 ENIs, 18/18 IPs (max-pods ~17), CPU idle 5-7% —
   diagnosed via AWS CLI ENI/IP counts (kube-API blocked). The certgen hook Job
   couldn't get an IP → couldn't schedule → helm hook timed out (and a taint-driven
   recreate DESTROYED ingress-nginx, taking ArgoCD down until restored). FIX (#149):
   `node_min_size=3` (the eks module IGNORES `desired_size`, so `min_size` is the
   lever; AWS rejects `min>desired`, so scale `desired`→3 via
   `aws eks update-nodegroup-config` FIRST) + the prefix-delegation addon. Restored
   to 3 healthy nodes; cert fix confirmed (`argocd login` OK).
4. **`crossplane-resources` app couldn't sync → XRDs never installed.** SPEC-S9
   `render-fixtures/{input,expected}.yaml` under `crossplane/xrds/platform-*/` were
   swept into the synced path, so each `render-probe-*` XR appeared TWICE → invalid
   sync → nothing applied. UNBLOCKED live by syncing only the XRDs+Compositions
   (`argocd app sync crossplane-resources --resource …`); DURABLE fix in this PR
   (`exclude: '**/render-fixtures/**'`). Then `argocd app sync platform-cluster-claim`
   applied the XR and Crossplane began provisioning (11 MRs). A
   `cluster-cert-validation-record` ReconcileError was transient ordering (waits on
   the cert's DNS-validation CNAME).

### Terminology + a half-done follow-up
- It's an **`XPlatformCluster` XR**, not a "claim" (Crossplane v2 has no claims —
  AGENTS §12.1). `platform-cluster-claim` is only the (v1-era) ArgoCD-app/file name.
- **prefix delegation is HALF done:** #149 adds the ADDON but NOT the kubelet
  `maxPods` bump (nodes still cap ~17). TRAP: `enable_bootstrap_user_data=true`
  emitted **AL2 `/etc/eks/bootstrap.sh`** user-data — WRONG for the AL2023 AMI, no
  `maxPods` — which would have failed node bootstrap and downed the cluster (caught
  by plan + user-data DECODE, not applied). To finish: pin
  `ami_type=AL2023_x86_64_STANDARD`, re-plan, DECODE the LT user-data to confirm
  nodeadm-format `maxPods: 110`, THEN apply (node recycle). 3×17≈51 slots suffices
  without it.
- **`crossplane render` CI breakage** (`unexpected argument internal`) fails
  `test_composition_render_fixtures.sh` on every push — ENVIRONMENTAL (crossplane CLI
  version), unrelated to any change here; needs its own pin fix (log to open-issues).

This session (auto-007) rebuilt the stack live and started phase 3:

| Phase | Live result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 base | apply-and-verify GREEN | run 27035432871 |
| 1 management | apply-and-verify GREEN — EKS `k8-platform-mgmt` ACTIVE, ArgoCD + Crossplane + providers + ESO + Kyverno + IRSA | run 27035617598 |
| 2 xrds | chainsaw dispatched (run on `534a0ce`) — check conclusion | chainsaw.yml |
| 3 cluster | **NOT yet synced** — blocked on ArgoCD 503 (see below) | — |

**Open in-flight (auto-007):** PRs #144 (trunk/envelope), #145 (phase-3 spoke
GitOps foundation, CI-green locally), + phase 4/5/6 scaffolding branches
(subagent-authored). Merge order in the run summary.

**Immediate next step — finish phase 3 live:** follow
`decisions/auto-009-phase3-live-completion-runbook.md` step-by-step (sync
`platform-cluster-claim` via ArgoCD → platform EKS + ACM cert → XSpokeAccess MRs
→ spoke registration → verify `https://hello.platform.<domain>`). The runbook has
the exact MR manifests (from the auto-008 R1/R2 adversarial review).

**ArgoCD 503 note (auto-007):** mgmt apply-and-verify passed WITH an ArgoCD
HTTPS-200 check (~19:45Z), but ArgoCD went 503 minutes later (argocd-server
settling after the app-of-apps sync). If still 503 on resume: re-poll
`https://argocd.management.<domain>/healthz` until 200, or dispatch
`phase=management action=verify` to force a CI-side re-check. Do NOT sandbox-kubectl
the EKS API (private CA — blocked from the sandbox; use ArgoCD/CI).

⚠️ Per AGENTS §8.4 a rotated account is FRESH+EMPTY. The CODE is durable in git;
live AWS resources are not. Re-verify with the live API before assuming.

### What this session proved (durable evidence — the code WORKS on a fresh account)

Built phases 0→2 live on a fresh account this session (before it expired):

| Phase | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 0 base | apply-and-verify GREEN | run 27021589131 |
| 1 management | apply-and-verify GREEN — EKS cluster ACTIVE, 2 nodes, ArgoCD UI HTTPS 200 (ExternalDNS Route53 record), Crossplane + all providers + ESO + Kyverno + IRSA + cluster-network EnvironmentConfig | run 27024349261 |
| 2 xrds (chainsaw) | 4/6 scenarios PASS (`claim-creates-secret`, `claim-rotation`, `xrd-establishes`, smoke); 2 FAIL on the known OI-2026-05-28-1 flake | run 27024518071 |

Phase 1 surfaced **3 real bugs** on the fresh account, all FIXED on PR #142
(these are why #142 must merge before the next rebuild):
- **OI-2026-06-05-2** — `charts.crossplane.io` 403s the GitHub runner. Fixed by
  vendoring the digest-verified chart at
  `terraform/management/vendor/crossplane-2.3.0.tgz`; both `helm.tf` and
  `tests/chainsaw/run.sh` install from it.
- **OI-2026-06-05-3/4** — `terraform_data.crossplane_aws_provider` raced the
  package manager and used a by-label selector the v2.5.0 family-provider
  Deployment doesn't carry. Fixed: wait for the Provider to be `Healthy`, then
  a label-agnostic SA-readiness check + diagnostics dump.

### Immediate next steps (in order)

1. **Merge PR #142 to main.** It carries the 3 phase-1 fixes (required for a
   clean rebuild) plus the ASM-cleanup fix, the unit-suite SIGPIPE-flake fix,
   AGENTS §8.5/§8.6, and the session plans/briefs. ArgoCD tracks `main`, so the
   fixes must be on main for the live build.
2. **Rebuild phase 0→1→2 on the fresh account** via CI (the fixes are now in):
   - `terraform-test.yml phase=base action=apply-and-verify`
   - `terraform-test.yml phase=management action=apply-and-verify` (the 3 bugs
     above are fixed; expect it to complete)
   - `chainsaw.yml` full set. If `composition-drift` / `claim-deletion-cleanup`
     time out on the ResourceExistsException flake (OI-2026-05-28-1 Issue A),
     re-kick once — established remedy.
3. **Phase 3 — provision the platform cluster.** The agent drives the
   `platform-cluster-claim` sync directly from the sandbox via the ArgoCD
   Terraform-output credential — see **Phase-3 sync** below (manual-sync stays).
4. **Phase 3 spoke (REQ-PLAT-02/03/04/06)** — build LIVE per the full execution
   plan in `decisions/auto-005-session-plan.md` (spoke registration, ingress-nginx
   with the cross-cluster cert ARN, ExternalDNS + spoke OIDC/IRSA, hello app,
   ApplicationSet; verify `https://hello.platform.<domain>`).

### Phase-3 sync — the AGENT drives it; manual-sync STAYS

`platform-cluster-claim` **stays manual-sync** (don't flip it to auto — an
everyday push must never kick off a real EKS-cluster provision). The agent
performs that manual sync **itself**, with no human and no new CI workflow:

1. The ArgoCD admin credential is created **at install time** and exposed as
   Terraform outputs (AGENTS §10.1): `argocd_admin_password` (sensitive) +
   `argocd_server_url` = `https://argocd.management.<domain>`. Get them from the
   `terraform/management` outputs.
2. ArgoCD is **internet-facing** (the NLB at `argocd.management.<domain>`, with a
   publicly-trusted ACM cert) and **the sandbox has permissive network egress**,
   so call the ArgoCD API **directly from the sandbox** — no CI proxy, no kube-API
   access needed:
   `argocd login "$argocd_server_url" --username admin --password "$argocd_admin_password" --grpc-web`
   then `argocd app sync platform-cluster-claim` (and `argocd app wait ...`).

Crossplane then provisions the platform EKS cluster + `*.platform.<domain>` ACM
cert (~20 min). Verify `status.certificateArn` + `CertificateValidation` Ready.

> **The thing sessions keep missing:** a service you *installed* that exposes a
> public endpoint is reachable **directly from the sandbox**. Create the
> credential at install time (done — it's a Terraform output) and call the API
> directly. Don't treat ArgoCD as "CI-only / unreachable" and don't hunt for a
> sync workflow. (Only the EKS *kube-API* — private CA — and reading TF state /
> AWS APIs without creds genuinely need CI.)

**Pre-check before syncing:** `provider-aws-eks` and `provider-aws-route53` were
still `HEALTHY=False` at 14m this session — confirm they reach Healthy (the
cluster XR needs them).

To CHECK AWS creds, dispatch a workflow (AGENTS §8.5) — do not assume stale.

## Environment State

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Active phase | **Account RESET 2026-06-06 (auto-007). Phase-3 XR provisioning was reached LIVE (11 MRs composing) then wiped. Nothing live now. Next: rebuild 0→1→2 (merge #142 + #149 + #150 + this PR), then phase-3 sync — the 4 blockers in QUICKSTART are all fixed. Phases 0-1 had VERIFIED live earlier (runs 27035432871 / 27035617598); auto-009 runbook drives phase-3.** |
| Last update | 2026-06-06 (auto-007 — phase-3 blockers cleared) |
| AWS account | **ephemeral — derive from `aws sts get-caller-identity`** (AGENTS §8.1) |
| Route53 zone | `<account-id>.realhandsonlabs.net.` |
| EKS cluster | `k8-platform-mgmt` in the region from `$AWS_REGION` |
| State backend | s3 `k8-platform-tfstate-<account-id>`, lock table `k8-platform-tfstate-lock` |

### Phase states

State semantics: `code-only` = never applied on THIS (fresh) account; `applied`
= applied this session; `verified` = applied AND probed. Cross-session
`applied`/`verified` are NOT durable (AGENTS §8.1) — treat all as `code-only`
on the next account until the live API proves otherwise.

| Phase | Code state | Last live result (account now gone) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 base | complete (main) | VERIFIED — run 27021589131 |
| 1 management | complete; **fixes on #142 (merge first)** | VERIFIED — run 27024349261 |
| 2 xrds | complete (main) + chainsaw vendored-chart fix on #142 | 4/6 chainsaw — run 27024518071 (2 known-flake fails) |
| 3 cluster+cert | complete (main, PR #140) | not applied — blocked on phase-3 mechanism |
| 3 spoke | not started | REQ-PLAT-02/03/04/06 — plan in decisions/auto-005-session-plan.md |

### Live AWS resource shape (when applied)

```
EKS cluster name:   k8-platform-mgmt
IRSA role names:    k8-platform-mgmt-{argocd,crossplane,eso,external-dns}
                    crossplane trust subject:
                      system:serviceaccount:crossplane-system:upbound-provider-family-aws
Route53 zone:       <account-id>.realhandsonlabs.net.
ACM wildcard cert:  *.<account-id>.realhandsonlabs.net (base) ; *.platform.<...> (platform cluster)
ASM secrets:        k8-platform/<XR-uid>
```

Run `scripts/whereami.sh` first to confirm the account (AGENTS §8.1).

---

## Open follow-ups (roughly prioritized)

1. **Merge PR #142** (see QUICKSTART step 1) — unblocks the rebuild.
2. **Phase-3 sync** (QUICKSTART) — agent runs `argocd app sync platform-cluster-claim`
   directly from the sandbox using the §10.1 Terraform-output cred; manual-sync stays.
3. **OI-2026-05-28-1 Issue A** (ASM `ResourceExistsException` flake on
   `composition-drift`/`claim-deletion-cleanup`): durable fix is the
   `crossplane.io/external-name` change in `decisions/auto-006-asm-external-name-fix.md`
   (Round-1 brief written; needs render-golden regen + live chainsaw to confirm
   the external-name format upjet expects). Until then, re-kick clears it.
4. **Unit-test coverage audit** — content audit for missing contracts (the
   §6.16 run.sh↔unit-tests.yml wiring is already satisfied via the catch-all).
5. **Rename surviving v1-era `*-claim` artifacts to `*-xr`** (AGENTS §12.1):
   `clusters/platform/platform-cluster-claim.yaml`, the ArgoCD Application
   `platform-cluster-claim`, the `claim-*` chainsaw scenario dirs. Own small PR.
6. **Orphaned chainsaw ASM secrets:** the cleanup sweep can't delete secrets
   whose MR is already gone at trap time; chainsaw runs may leave `k8-platform/<uid>`
   secrets in the account (different uids, so no collision). Minor.

See `docs/open-issues.md` for the full register (OI-2026-05-28-1,
OI-2026-06-05-1/2/3/4).

## Critical behavioral rules

| Action | Evidence to check |
|---|---|
| `terraform apply` on management | Look for `Plan: N to add`. Zero changes after a manifest edit = `triggers_replace` missing a hash. See `docs/runbooks/runbook-apply-zero-resources.md`. |
| Provider SA (IRSA) | The v2.5.0 family-provider Deployment is NOT labelled `pkg.crossplane.io/provider=provider-family-aws` (OI-2026-06-05-4). Verify by pod: `kubectl -n crossplane-system get pods -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.spec.serviceAccountName}{"\n"}{end}'` must include `upbound-provider-family-aws`; the SA object must exist. |
| IRSA trust | `aws iam get-role --role-name k8-platform-mgmt-crossplane --query 'Role.AssumeRolePolicyDocument'` |
| XR Ready | `kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready --timeout=180s ...` is the unambiguous signal. |
| ArgoCD app | `kubectl get application <name> -n argocd -o jsonpath='{.status.sync.status}/{.status.health.status}'` must be `Synced/Healthy`. |

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Multi-cluster pattern | Hub-spoke via ArgoCD | Management cluster manages all others |
| Cluster provisioning | Crossplane XRDs (v2 namespaced XRs) | Self-service composites |
| Secret distribution | ESO + AWS Secrets Manager | Single source of truth |
| TLS | Per-cluster DNS-validated ACM cert provisioned by the cluster Composition + NLB termination (no cert-manager/ACME) | docs/decisions/0003 |
| Ephemeral inputs (subnets/zone/domain) | `cluster-network` EnvironmentConfig materialized from base Terraform outputs | docs/decisions/0003, ADR-e557a40123 |
| State backend | S3 + DynamoDB | Standard; auto-bootstrapped by CI |
| Instance sizing | `t3.medium` × 2 | Fits within 9-instance EC2 quota |
| Crossplane chart source | vendored tarball, not charts.crossplane.io | CDN 403s the runner (OI-2026-06-05-2) |

## Scripts inventory

| Script | One-liner |
|---|---|
| `scripts/whereami.sh` | One call for account, region, EKS, zone, kubectl ctx, ArgoCD URL, Crossplane version (SPEC-S4). |
| `scripts/irsa_trust_validator.py` | IRSA fleet sweep — `--all --ci` for gating, `--role <arn>` for triage (SPEC-S3). |
| `scripts/composition-render.sh` | SPEC-S9 author-time `crossplane render` dry-run vs committed golden. |
| `scripts/pre-chainsaw-audit.sh` | Static audit before any `chainsaw.yml` dispatch (AGENTS §6.13). |
