# SUBSTRATE-READINESS.md — the definition of "done" for the platform bring-up

This file exists because "done" kept meaning *"I made the live symptom go away with a
hand-fix"* instead of *"the committed code produces a working platform from nothing."*
Those are different, and conflating them is why the same gaps keep biting on every
fresh account.

This is a **gate, not a wish.** An item is DONE only when its **Clean-build evidence**
column holds a verifiable pointer. No pointer ⇒ the status is
`pending clean-build verification` — never "done", "fixed", "works", or "proven".

---

## Definition of done (the only one)

> A build from **committed `main`** — terraform phases 0→1 via CI `apply-and-verify`,
> then the spoke via **ArgoCD GitOps** synced from committed `main` — brings up
> **hub Ready + spoke Ready + `hello.platform.<domain>` → HTTP 200 (valid public cert)**,
> with **ZERO manual steps**.

The substrate is not done until that is true and captured with evidence below.

## What counts as a manual step (i.e. a FAILURE of the definition)

If a clean bring-up needs **any** of these, it is **not** done — the thing that
required the step is an open blocker, not a closed issue:

- An inline IAM policy / `aws iam put-role-policy` to make a controller work.
- `aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress` (hub→spoke or otherwise).
- `aws ec2 create-tags` on subnets.
- A hand `kubectl apply` / `kubectl create namespace` of anything ArgoCD/Crossplane
  should own.
- An `argocd app set` / `kubectl patch` overlay of a placeholder value.
- Pausing or `ignoreDifferences`-ing `bootstrap` to make an overlay stick.
- Hand-registering the spoke cluster Secret with ArgoCD.

## What counts as Clean-build evidence (the only thing that earns a checkmark)

- A **CI run ID** of `terraform-test.yml apply-and-verify` from the committed branch
  (the IAM/terraform layer), **AND**
- a **GitOps sync from committed `main`/the branch** (no out-of-band patches), **AND**
- the relevant **behavioral check passing on that build** (the live-suite check or a
  recorded `kubectl`/`curl` result).

A live hand-fix is **NOT** evidence. It validates the *mechanism*, never the *artifact*.

**SHA map (four SHAs, in order):** `bc1cbb6fe27b976dee0b4e86953114481ca15d51`

`18a4205292d64ff8b3946310c59801d24b5144ca` = the build-branch commit (Kyverno
removal) the base and management applies ran from; its `argocd/`, `clusters/`
and `crossplane/` trees are **byte-identical** to `bc1cbb6` (they differ only
under terraform/, tests/, docs/), which is what makes the gate syncs
legitimate clean-source syncs ·
`4364d4ae72e769f98ae657d65a23ff00fd775269` = the branch head for the

the revision every ArgoCD Application reports as synced and the SHA
live-verify and the live-evidence gate both ran against.

`bc1cbb6`, `.status.sync.revision` observed equal to it afterwards — which
establishes that the Application's target revision was that SHA, **not**
that a sync operation completed at it (Argo sets that field from the target
revision it has observed, so it can already hold the right SHA before any
sync; the stronger `.status.operationState` check that would have proved a
completed sync at that SHA was not performed on this build — kp-2al.24,
found 2026-09-10): XPlatformCluster
`platform/platform` published `oidcIssuer`, `endpoint`, `clusterCaData` and
`certificateArn`, nodegroup `platform-78032583fa77` reached Ready, **15 min**
from sync → gate 2 `spoke-access`, same explicit SHA, `.status.sync.revision`
observed equal to it with the same caveat:
registration Secret `platform-spoke` appeared in hub namespace `argocd`
**within the first 30-second check**, carrying the full ADR-0010 contract
(all the `k8-platform.io/*` annotations; `config` decoding to
`awsAuthConfig.clusterName` = `k8-platform-services` plus 1492 bytes of
caData); XSpokeAccess Ready=True at 4m10s, XPlatformCluster Ready=True at
20m, 20:37:02Z. App stack at that convergence: every hub Application
Synced/Healthy except `spoke-observability-kube-prometheus-stack` (Degraded)
and `spoke-observability-loki` (Progressing) — the storage gap — and
`workload1-cluster` (OutOfSync by design). **No AWS or Kubernetes state was
hand-mutated at any point in this build.**
**The storage half (OI-2026-06-11-3):** after PR #265 merged to `main`, ArgoCD
auto-synced every Application to `96279fd` **with no manual step**, creating
the new `spoke-storage` Application (Synced/Healthy) and delivering the
composition change. Result on the spoke: `aws-ebs-csi-driver` addon ACTIVE,
version `v1.65.0-eksbuild.2`, under the composed IRSA role
`k8-platform-k8-platform-services-ebs-csi`; CSI driver `ebs.csi.aws.com`
registered; StorageClass `gp3 (default)`, provisioner `ebs.csi.aws.com`,
WaitForFirstConsumer, expandable; **all 3 monitoring PVCs Bound on gp3**; and
`spoke-observability-kube-prometheus-stack` + `spoke-observability-loki` both
went to **Healthy**. The gap is closed — with the PVC-ordering caveat below.

— and the fail-closed **live-evidence gate** run **34414013044** (`main` @
`96279fd`) read that evidence as satisfying: success.
**Caveats on this build — recorded, not softened:**

- **Not a single-SHA build.** Terraform applied from branch `18a4205` (later
  `4364d4a`); the gates synced `main` @ `bc1cbb6`; the storage half only
  became live after the merge to `96279fd`. The GitOps paths were
  byte-identical between `18a4205` and `bc1cbb6`, which is why the gate syncs
  are legitimate clean-source syncs — but no single SHA produced all of the
  evidence above.
- **The merge to `main` preceded the live evidence for the storage change, by
  an explicit one-time owner exception granted 2026-09-09.** Reason: ArgoCD
  auto-syncs `crossplane/` and `argocd/` from `main` with selfHeal, so a
  composition change can never be live while it is only on a branch, while
  `live-evidence-verify` demands a full live-verify pass at the pushed SHA — a
  circularity. The exception was granted on the condition that the change be
  backed out of `main` immediately if it did not work; it worked, so nothing
  was backed out. **This is an exception, not a precedent, and the underlying
  circularity is still open.**
- **The row-10/row-11 evidence comes from the POST-FIX oracle run.** An
  earlier run on this same build, RUN_ID `build6-2042`, was pass=21 skip=4
  **fail=1**. Both bad results were defects in the checks, not in the
  platform, and both were fixed in this build's own commits: `kp-8vs` (the
  federation check read only the first redirect hop, so it could never pass,
  and its skip text blamed a realm-import ordering race the evidence ruled
  out) and `kp-7ei` (the Secrets Manager check set an external-name
  annotation that is inert for that kind, so the provider asked AWS for a
  `terraform-`prefixed name the correctly scoped policy denied — CloudTrail
  showed AccessDenied retried through the whole 300 s window).
- **The PVCs on this build predated the default StorageClass.** They had been
  created unclassed while no default existed and bound retroactively once gp3
  arrived. A from-scratch build creates them after the class exists, so the
  class-then-PVC ordering is **not** what this build proved: that ordering is
  **pending clean-build verification**.
- **The suite still exits 3** over four kinds its derived expect-full list
  declares but no check verifies: `ec2.aws.m.upbound.io/SecurityGroup`,
  `generators.external-secrets.io/Password`,
  `rds.aws.m.upbound.io/SubnetGroup`,
  `secretsmanager.aws.m.upbound.io/SecretVersion`. The printed summary counter
  contradicts that by reading `expect-full-violations=0` (bead `kp-lc5`). CI's
  explicit `LIVE_EXPECT_FULL` list is a different, 14-kind list, which is why
  live-verify passed. **Open gap, not a pass.**
- **Three checks skipped structurally** because hub-fixture checks read the
  single spoke-targeted `LIVE_CLUSTER` (bead `kp-ug3`): the two ArgoCD
  AppProject guards and the Crossplane RBAC scope guard.
- Two gate syncs and the sandbox oracle run were human/agent-initiated from
  the sandbox. The gate syncs are the documented human gate step, not
  out-of-band mutation.

Build #6: same CREATE path green again (mgmt run 34397369089, re-apply 34410469157) — relay oracle PASS (the kube-relay rule functions) and the hub synced every spoke app over the private endpoint (the API rule functions). | **DONE (4× clean build)** |
| 8 | Hello hub→spoke e2e (OI-2026-06-08-2) | PR #210 (check authored) | Builds #1–#3: PASS on all three accounts (HTTP 200 + body marker + hub-side `spoke-hello` Synced+Healthy; 1s to first 200 on builds #2+#3). Build #5: PASS (21 s). Build #6: PASS (HTTP 200 + body marker after 1 s; hub-side `spoke-hello` Synced/Healthy; RUN_ID build6-2220). | **DONE (5× clean build)** |
| 9 | Keycloak **boots** against RDS through the spoke ingress (OI-2026-06-07-5) | cross-cluster DB path (hub PushSecret → ASM → spoke ExternalSecret + extraEnvVarsSecret host/port) | Clean build #3: `keycloak-e2e-live.sh` PASS — realm imports, https OIDC discovery 200. Four first-boot defects fixed in code mid-build (#231–#234). Build #5: `keycloak-e2e-live.sh` PASS again — and the DB path now rides the ADR-0012 material chain end-to-end (its first oracle-recorded build). Build #6: PASS again on the rotated account (OIDC discovery 200 with the expected issuer, hub `spoke-keycloak` Synced/Healthy, RUN_ID build6-2220) — and this is the build where the realm's Cognito broker imported (row 10). | **DONE (3× clean build)** |
| 10 | Keycloak **federation live-wired** to Cognito (REQ-AUTH-02/08) | BUILT 2026-07-06 (this branch): the broker + mappers are back in the realm as `${KC_COGNITO_*}` env placeholders substituted at `--import-realm` (mechanism verified empirically on the pinned Keycloak 24.0.5); delivery = terraform/base → ASM `k8-platform/base/cognito` → spoke ES → NON-optional secretKeyRef env (fail-closed, the #233 class prevented by construction). Contract pinned by `test_keycloak_cognito_idp_contract.sh`; committed realm boot-verified in docker. NOTE: a live realm never re-imports (IGNORE_EXISTING) — first live exercise is the next from-scratch build. | Realm import runs only on a fresh Keycloak DB ⇒ evidence must come from a clean build with this merged; the federation oracle (`cognito-federation-live.sh`) records it. Hosted-UI leg live-verified standalone on build #5. Post-merge retrofit (2026-07-06, build-#5 cluster): the DELIVERY chain proved live — base apply 28761827039 staged ASM `k8-platform/base/cognito`, spoke ES synced 12 s later (8-key Secret), both KC pods rolled with the fail-closed `KC_COGNITO_*` env; broker confirmed ABSENT in the live realm via the admin API (IGNORE_EXISTING, as documented) — the import half is exactly what build #6 must evidence. A live-drift defect in the new ES manifest (three ESO CRD-default enums omitted from `dataFrom[].extract`) was found and fixed red-first this branch (L40 lint). **Clean build #6 (2026-09-09, rotated account — see the build-#6 block above) is the flip:** the realm imported on a fresh Keycloak DB from committed source (delivery rode base apply **34396955442** → ASM `k8-platform/base/cognito` → spoke ES → fail-closed `KC_COGNITO_*` env), and the federation oracle PASSED on that build (sandbox, RUN_ID `build6-2220`, `LIVE_PROFILE=full`, mode mutating, 22:20Z–22:28Z, against merged `main` `96279fd`): the broker chain leaves Keycloak for the Cognito `/oauth2/authorize` endpoint, brokered login issued an authorization code (the Cognito → Keycloak leg live), id_token claims correct — `preferred_username=oracle-build6-2220@federation-oracle.invalid`, groups ∋ `k8s-viewers`. Two caveats recorded with it: the evidence is from the POST-FIX oracle run (the earlier `build6-2042` run was fail=1 on a defect in the CHECK — it read only the first redirect hop, bead `kp-8vs`, fixed in this build's own commits), and build #6 is not a single-SHA build (SHA map in the build-#6 block). | **DONE (1× clean build: #6)** |
| 11 | EKS clusters federate kubectl auth to Keycloak (REQ-AUTH-07/09/10) | BUILT 2026-07-06 (this branch): `IdentityProviderConfig` composed into the platform-cluster Composition (resource 16 — clientId `kubernetes`, `preferred_username`/`groups`, both prefixed `kc:`, issuer combined from the same env pair as the ACM cert + KC_HOSTNAME; external-name `keycloak`). Ships with its coverage-oracle entry, live check, claim-contract unit test, regenerated render golden, and CRD schema. The REQ-AUTH-10 federation oracle (`cognito-federation-live.sh`) drives the whole path headlessly with a self-reaped directory fixture user. | **Post-merge observed live 2026-07-06** on the build-#5 cluster: the XR gained the association by GitOps auto-sync and it reached ACTIVE — `eks-identity-provider-config-live` PASS, composite XR Ready=True (no wedge). That proves the EKS-side half live, but is NOT clean-build evidence: the realm broker (rows-10 half) only imports on a fresh Keycloak DB, so the composed-from-scratch + federation-oracle evidence still records on the next clean build. **Clean build #6 (2026-09-09) records it:** the IdentityProviderConfig `keycloak` on `k8-platform-services` was composed from scratch and reached ACTIVE with claims matching the `kc-*` binding contract (issuer `https://auth.platform.<domain>/realms/platform`), and federated kubectl PASSED on that build — `username=kc:oracle-build6-2220@federation-oracle.invalid groups∋kc:k8s-viewers` on `k8-platform-services` (RUN_ID `build6-2220`, mutating, against merged `main` `96279fd`). Same two caveats as row 10: post-fix oracle run, and build #6 is not a single-SHA build. | **DONE (1× clean build: #6)** |

Clean build #1 also caught and durably fixed a NEW defect mid-build —
**OI-2026-06-10-1** (ACM provider v2.5.0 leaves the Certificate external-name
empty; `certificateArnSelector` could never resolve; fixed in PR #223 by
routing the ARN through the composite) — which is the build loop working as
designed: the failure produced a code fix, not a hand-fix.

**No row may flip to DONE without filling its evidence column.** The agent does not
get to assert these are fixed; you (or anyone) can audit each one by clicking the
run ID.

## The order of operations to actually finish

1. ~~Build the four missing durable fixes (#2–#5).~~ **DONE** (PRs #218/#220/#221/#222).
2. ~~Integration branch + rebuild from committed source with ZERO manual steps.~~
   **DONE ONCE** — clean build #1 above (2026-06-10). The mid-build defect it
   caught (OI-2026-06-10-1) was fixed in code (PR #223) and converged by GitOps.
3. ~~Second green clean build.~~ **DONE** — clean build #2 above (2026-06-11,
   account 608553548146): same recipe, zero manual steps, all three oracles <!-- noqa: account-id - run provenance, account rotates -->
   PASS. **The green-twice posture gate is satisfied.**
4. ~~Rows 6/7 (RDS/EC2 narrowing on the CREATE path) + OI-2026-06-07-5
   keycloak DB path.~~ **DONE** — clean build #3 (2026-06-12, account
   798802785871): RDS in the base VPC, Keycloak boots against it, row 9 <!-- noqa: account-id - run provenance, account rotates -->
   earned. Rows 6/7 now 2×.
5. ~~Phase-5 identity half (rows 10/11) — build the feature.~~ **BUILT**
   (2026-07-06, the clean-build-5-evidence branch): broker + mappers +
   EKS IdP config + the federation oracle, contract-docs-first per the
   documentation plan. Rows 10/11 flip on the next clean build's recorded
   evidence — a live realm never re-imports, so build #6 is the earliest
   honest flip. **FLIPPED** on clean build #6 (2026-09-09): the realm
   imported the broker on a fresh Keycloak DB and the federation oracle
   PASSED (RUN_ID `build6-2220`), rows 10/11 now DONE.
6. ~~The live-evidence producer green so the PR gate flips.~~ **DONE**
   (build #5): live-verify green with secretsmanager/Secret + iam
   OIDC/RolePolicy in expect-full; the fail-closed PR gate has its first
   producer. Remaining test-overhaul work (SKIP-kind flips, Track B)
   proceeds from here.
7. ~~Clean build #6: rows 10/11 + the OI-2026-06-11-3 storage gap.~~
   **DONE** — clean build #6 above (2026-09-09, rotated account): rows 10
   and 11 flipped on recorded oracle evidence (RUN_ID `build6-2220`),
   live-verify **34412419016** green and the fail-closed live-evidence gate
   **34414013044** read it as satisfying, and the spoke now ships the EBS
   CSI addon + default gp3 StorageClass with all 3 monitoring PVCs Bound
   and both observability Applications Healthy. Still owed out of this
   build, carried as blockers rather than buried: the class-then-PVC
   ordering (**pending clean-build verification** — these PVCs predated the
   class), the suite's exit-3 expect-full gap and its contradicting summary
   counter (`kp-lc5`), the three structural hub-fixture skips (`kp-ug3`),
   and the merge-before-live-evidence circularity the one-time owner
   exception papered over.

A fix that cannot be validated this way stays `pending clean-build
verification` and is carried as a **blocker**, not silently deferred into the
open-issues graveyard.
